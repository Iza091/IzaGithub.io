### 🧠 I Even Noticed This  
Small details for the curious developer in you:

- 🧩 **Half designer, half developer** — I tweak my UI spacing as much as I refactor logic.
- 🐧 **Linux by day, Windows Server by VM** — I like living in multiple OS worlds.
- 🧪 **Parrot OS for security labs** — Yes, I break and patch for fun.
- 🎮 **My fake game download site?** Just a honeypot to teach people about phishing 🧠
- ⚙️ **Yes, I chose Chimchar in Platinum. Twice.** I like starting fires.
- 🌀 **I keep Tailwind light** — because I like freedom, not bloated utility wars.
- 📚 **React + CoreUI + NestJS = my playground** — And yes, I made them talk nicely together.
- 🧑‍🔬 **I test my backend with Postman, but make it look like a sci-fi terminal.**
- 🌍 **My portfolio isn't just responsive — it's reactive to who’s watching.**
- 🔍 **Dark mode is the default. Light mode? Only if you *really* insist.**
- ⚡ **I’ve animated more `gifs` in a README than I probably should, but you stayed, didn’t you?**
- 👾 **Ask me why my CSS always has one sneaky transition property. I dare you.**
- 🧵 **“Iza” isn’t short for anything, but it is optimized.**
- 🔐 **I built fake malware pages for awareness. Don’t worry, they only *look* dangerous.**
- 📖 **My GitHub is more than projects — it’s a personal journal in disguise.**
- 🧠 **Everything I build has one secret purpose: to learn something I didn’t know yesterday.**
